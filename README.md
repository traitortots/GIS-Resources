# GIS-Resources

This repo contains a variety of geographic information systems (GIS) resources I've collected and curated. This started as a resource for an Intro to GIS class I was TAing, and I've continued to add to it ever since!

Visit the links below for specific types of resources:
 - [Data Sources](data-sources.md)
 - [Learning Resources](learning-resources.md)

You can also visit these repos for more GIS resources
