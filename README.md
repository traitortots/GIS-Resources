# GIS Resources

This repo contains a variety of geographic information systems (GIS) resources I've collected and curated. This started as a resource for an Intro to GIS class I was TAing, and I've continued to add to it ever since. Forks and PRs welcome if you have something to add to any of the areas, please open an issue with any questions, corrections, or dead links. Thanks, and enjoy!
